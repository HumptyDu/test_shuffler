# test_shuffler
This is a python script that takes at least one text file as an input and creates a cycle of infinitely shuffling questions. Used to practice vocab for new classes.

This program allows the user to store different categories of questions. For example, let's assume a user is using this app to practice Spanish vocab. In a Spanish class, vocab is introduced chapter-by-chapter based on topic. To be concrete, let's say that the first chapter coveres food vocab and the second chapter covers animal vocab. This program allows you to insert separate text files and 

It takes a text file with the following formatting:
key - value
key - value
key - value
...

A more concrete example (say, a Spanish-English mapping with the topic of ):

Note that there should be a dash between every key/value pair
    Note: This means that there can be NO dashes in either the keys or the values
